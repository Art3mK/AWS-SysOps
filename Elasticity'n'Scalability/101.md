# Elasticity vs Scalability

Elasticity - scaling out
- increase number of EC2 instances, based on autoscaling
- increase IOPS for traffic spikes in DynamoDB
- RDS is not very elastic

Scalability - scaling up
- instance size increase
- unlimited amount of storage in DynamoDB
- increase instance size for RDS
